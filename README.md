AssetManager
=======================
Version 0.0.1 Created by Wesley Overdijk and Marco Pivetta

Introduction
------------
Currently, the module, in its current state, is nothing. It's under heavy development right now and should be in a useful state pretty soon.
The module is an Asset Manager module for [Zend Framework 2 (from here referred to as ZF2)](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2),
which allows you to find assets, filter assets and cache them the way you want to.
This offers great flexibility to hook in and supply your own resolvers, filters and caching methods.
Depending heavily on Assetic this module already supplies a lot of proven to work functionality.
